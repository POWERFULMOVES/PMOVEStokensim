# PMOVES Token Simulator Documentation

## Overview

The PMOVES Token Simulator is a tool for comparing traditional economic models with cooperative economic models. It allows users to explore how different parameters affect economic outcomes and to understand the potential benefits of cooperative economic approaches.

## Documentation Sections

1. [Mathematical Model](./mathematical-model.md) - Explains the mathematical model used in the simulator, including its strengths and limitations.
2. [Scenario Presets](./scenario-presets.md) - Describes the pre-configured scenarios available in the simulator.
3. [Key Metrics](./key-metrics.md) - Explains the key metrics used to evaluate the simulation results.
4. [Interpretation Guide](./interpretation-guide.md) - Provides guidance on how to interpret the simulation results.

## Getting Started

To get started with the simulator, select a preset scenario from the dropdown menu or adjust the parameters manually. Click the "Run Simulation" button to see the results.

The simulator will display the results in several formats:
- Summary metrics comparing the two economic scenarios
- Charts showing the evolution of key metrics over time
- Detailed analysis of the final state of the economy

## Key Concepts

### Traditional Economy (Scenario A)

The traditional economy represents a standard economic model where individuals spend money primarily outside their community. This leads to wealth leakage and limited community resilience.

### Cooperative Economy (Scenario B)

The cooperative economy represents a model where individuals spend a portion of their money within the community, participate in group buying and local production, and use a community currency (GroTokens). This leads to wealth retention, increased resilience, and reduced inequality.

### GroTokens

GroTokens are a community currency that rewards participation in the cooperative economy. They provide additional liquidity and help keep wealth within the community.
