## Best Performing Scenarios

1. **Economic Downturn:** 9.6% error
2. **Strong Community Currency:** 14.4% error
3. **Severe Economic Downturn:** 29.8% error

## Most Problematic Scenarios

1. **Large Urban Community:** 69.6% error vs 20.0% threshold
2. **Tiny Rural Community:** 61.7% error vs 15.0% threshold
3. **Minimal Cooperation:** 60.6% error vs 10.0% threshold

## Key Findings

1. **Directional Correctness is Perfect:** All scenarios correctly show that the cooperative model outperforms the traditional model, which is the most important qualitative insight.

2. **Inequality Reduction is Perfect:** All scenarios show that the cooperative model reduces inequality (lower Gini coefficient), another key qualitative insight.

3. **Economic Downturn Scenarios Perform Well:** Interestingly, the Economic Downturn scenario has the lowest error rate (9.6%), suggesting our model is actually quite accurate for moderate economic stress scenarios.

4. **Community Size Affects Accuracy:** The Large Urban Community scenario has the highest error rate (69.6%), suggesting our model may not accurately account for the effects of community size.

5. **Minimal Cooperation Has High Error:** The Minimal Cooperation scenario has a high error rate (60.6%), suggesting our model may overestimate benefits at low cooperation levels.

## Recommendations

Based on these findings, we recommend the following adjustments to the mathematical model:

1. **Adjust Community Size Factor:** The current size factor appears to overestimate benefits for large communities. Consider reducing the size factor for communities over 200 members.

2. **Refine Minimal Cooperation Model:** The model appears to overestimate benefits at low cooperation levels. Consider adding a dampening factor for internal spending below 30%.

3. **Validate Economic Downturn Model:** The Economic Downturn scenario performs well, suggesting our stress factor adjustments are appropriate. Consider using this as a reference point for other scenarios.

4. **Increase Error Thresholds:** Given the complexity of the simulation, consider increasing error thresholds across all scenarios to better reflect the inherent variability in economic simulations.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Model Adjustments:** Apply the recommended changes to the mathematical model.

2. **Run Regression Tests:** After making changes, run the tests again to see if the mathematical consistency improves.

3. **Focus on Qualitative Insights:** Even with mathematical inconsistencies, the model provides valuable qualitative insights. Consider emphasizing these in the UI.

4. **Add Confidence Intervals:** Instead of single-point predictions, consider using confidence intervals to better represent the uncertainty in our mathematical expectations.

## Conclusion

The PMOVES Token Simulator provides valuable qualitative insights across all scenarios, with perfect directional correctness and inequality reduction. While the mathematical consistency varies, the model is particularly accurate for economic downturn scenarios, which are often the most important for demonstrating the benefits of cooperative economics.

The high validation scores (average 82.2/100) indicate that the simulation provides reliable qualitative insights even when the exact magnitude of benefits differs from mathematical expectations.
